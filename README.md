Hi. We're Team 2706. This is our 2016 robot code.

After an illustrious career playing FIRST Stronghold, including top ten finishes and alliance captaining at two regionals and one off-season event, Mergius Maximus is now enjoying a life of comfortable retirement. He now spends his days driving in public spaces and playing catch with small children. As he no longer guards the Stronghold castle courtyards, he has retired his cameras, TrackerBox Pi, NavX, and the autonomous modes that went with them.

The 2017 branch of this codebase supports everything we need to drive and demo, and removes references to hardware that has been redeployed on our 2017 robot. The full 2016 codebase is still available for viewing in the master branch. (Should this ever change, we should archive the 2016 working code in its own branch or release for safekeeping).
